I'm a PHD student from [School of Software Engineering ](https://sse.sysu.edu.cn), [Sun Yet-Sun University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn), supervised by Zibin Zheng and Yanlin Wang. My email is zhengdw5@mail2.sysu.edu.cn

I primarily focus on tasks related to code intelligence, leveraging artificial intelligence methods to enhance the application of code-related tasks in real-world scenarios. Specific tasks include code generation, code search, code summarization, and so on.

My research area is: __The integration of large language models and software engineering__, including __Code Generation__, __Code Search__, __Code Summarization.__
